autoextract-poet documentation
==============================

``autoextract-poet`` contains the common item definitions. Such items can
be extracted automatically using Zyte `AutoExtract API`_ (you can use
`scrapy-poet`_ and `scrapy-autoextract`_ for this).

The `AutoExtract API`_ is able to convert pages into data automatically.
It support multiple types of pages, like articles, products, real estate,
comments, job posting, reviews, etc. See the full list of supported
page types `here <https://docs.zyte.com/automatic-extraction.html#result-fields>`_.

See also `web-poet`_  for an introduction about the Page Objects
paradigm and the `scrapy-poet tutorial`_ for an introduction
about how to use Page Objects with Scrapy spiders.
